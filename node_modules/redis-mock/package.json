  "readme": "redis-mock\n============\nThe goal of the redis-mock project is to create a feature-complete mock of https://github.com/mranney/node_redis, so that it may be used interchangeably when writing unit tests for code that depends on Redis.\n\nAll operations are performed in-memory, why no Redis installation is required.\n\nInstall with:\n\n\tnpm install redis-mock\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nvar redis = require(\"redis-mock\"),\n    client = redis.createClient();\n```\n\n# API\n\nredis-mock is a WIP, why most commands are not yet available. Currently implemented are the following:\n\n## General\n\n* createClient\n* end\n\n## Events\n\n* ready\n* connect\n* end\n* subscribe\n* unsubscribe\n* message\n\n## Publish/subscribe\n* publish\n* subscribe\n* unsubscribe\n\n## Keys\n* del\n* keys\n* exists\n* expire\n\n## Strings\n* get\n* set\n\n## Hashing\n* hset\n* hsetnx\n* hget\n* hexists\n* hdel\n* hlen\n* hgetall\n* hmset\n* hkeys\n* hincrby\n\n## Lists\n* llen\n* lpush\n* rpush\n* lpushx\n* rpushx\n* lpop\n* rpop\n* blpop\n* brpop\n* lindex\n* lset\n\n## Server\n* flushdb\n* flushall\n\n## Cross verification\n\nIf you want to add new tests to the test base it is important that they work too on node_redis (we are creating a mock...).\nYou can therefore run the tests using `redis` instead of `redis-mock`. To do so:\n\n```\n\tmake check-tests\n```\n\n> You will need to have a running instance of redis on you machine and our tests use `flushdb a lot so make sure you don't have anything important on it.\n\n## LICENSE - \"MIT License\"\n\nCopyright (c) 2012 Kristian Faeldt <kristian.faeldt@gmail.com>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person\nobtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation\nfiles (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without\nrestriction, including without limitation the rights to use,\ncopy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the\nSoftware is furnished to do so, subject to the following\nconditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES\nOF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\nNONINFRINGEMENT.
